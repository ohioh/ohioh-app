OHIHO is a german non profit organisation and we are doing research on helping the world with preventing pandemic
with our PWA tracing application. And of course it is fully opensource.

A progressive web application is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices.
Progressive Web Apps are web apps that use emerging web browser APIs and features along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. Progressive Web Apps are a useful design pattern, though they aren't a formalized standard. PWA can be thought of as similar to AJAX or other similar patterns that encompass a set of application attributes, including use of specific web technologies and techniques. This set of docs tells you all you need to know about them.
## BLE
![alt text](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Flocatify.com%2Fblog%2Fbeacon-faq%2F&psig=AOvVaw2v0G5HlhL0HwJKNFMpzHbc&ust=1607262563886000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKC41fL9tu0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)
BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE, and marketed as Bluetooth Smart).

Bluetooth Low Energy is a form of wireless communication designed especially for short-range communication.  BLE is very similar to Wi-Fi in the sense that it allows devices to communicate with each other. However, BLE is meant for situations where battery life is preferred over high data transfer speeds. For example, say you want to broadcast marketing campaigns in the close proximity of a newly launched headphone. The amount of data you need to transfer to a visitor’s smartphone is extremely small, hence Bluetooth LE compatible beacons do the job quickly without draining the battery.

## Getting Started

The project might have multiple branches: `master`, `Gui`  which are explained here

* `master` contains aggregate code of all branches
* `development` contains code under development of GUI.

### Tools Required

All tools required go here. You would require the following tools to develop and run the project:

* A text editor or an IDE (like IntelliJ)
* Mention the other tools required for the project 

### Installation

All installation steps go here.

* Installing a particular tool
  * Steps to complete it
  
* Installing another tool

## Development

This section is completely optional. For big projects, the developement strategies are not discussed. But for small projects, you can give some insight to people. It has 2 benefits in my opinion:

1. It's a way to give back to the community. People get to learn from you and appreciate your work
2. You can refer the README in future as a quick refresher before an interview or for an old project to check if it can help you in your currect work

### Part 1: Heading

#### Step 1: Subheading

* Mention the steps here
  * You can also have nested steps to break a step into small tasks
  
#### Step 2: Subheading

* Mention the steps here.
  * You can also have nested steps to break a step into small tasks

For details now how everything has been implemented, refer the source code

### Part 2: Heading

* Mention the steps here

## Running the App

Steps and commands for running the app are to be included here

* Example steps:
  ```
    Example command
